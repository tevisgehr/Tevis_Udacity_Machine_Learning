    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "This model should be able to provide quick and interpretable results. This model has been chosen because of its simplicity and speed. It will be used in one of two ways. If it achieves competitive performance metrics (accuracy and F-score) then it will likely be the best canidat due to its speed. If not, it can be used as a kind of baseline against which to compare the other two more sophisicated models. It is worth noting that this model may not work well for this problem due to the possibility of dependencies between the features. Nevertheless it is worth the short amount of computation to try.\n",
    "\n",
    "### K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) is an algorithm that classifies an instance based only on the data-points that are closest in the feature-space. This requires the definintion of a distance measure. A classic example of KNN usage is in real estate value prediction, in which a property is classified to be the same value level as the properties that it is closest too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:  \n",
    "-No training time. \n",
    "-Can model very complex situations that are difficult for other models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:  \n",
    "-Slow to classify, especially with large datasets.\n",
    "-No interpetability.\n",
    "-Doesn't work well with high numbers of dimentions.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good canidate for the problem:  \n",
    "This model is a good choce because it is non-paramertric and non-linear and can therefore model trends that most other models would not be able to. Because of its key differences from other models, KNN is a good choice as a means of comparing differnt approches. Also, KNN is appropriate because the size of the dataset is relatively small. If there were ten times as many samples (as could easliy be the case in many situations), the KNN model would probably be too slow.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "Support vector machines are a set of algorithms that separate data by maximizing the margin between the closest points and the classifier boundary. Because of this, only a small amount of the data is needed to represent the model. SVM's also employ the use of 'kernels' that allow one to create non-linear decicion boundaries by projecting data into higher dimentions. Because of the some of the good mathematical properties of SVM's they have a history of being used in cutting edge research and high technology. One recent example is having been used in self-driving car algoritms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths:  \n",
    "-Fast(er) to classify.  \n",
    "-Highly tunable.  \n",
    "-Various other good mathematical properties.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses:    \n",
    "-Slow to train.  \n",
    "-Complicated.    \n",
    "-Prone to overfitting.  \n",
    "-Difficult to tune. \n",
    "\n",
    "What makes this model a good canidate for the problem:  \n",
    "Support vector machines are appropriate to this problem because they are highly tunable and able to handle a wide range of situations. Overfitting can be an issue with this algorith, but there are enough data points that is should be avoidable with proper tuning of the C parameter (error penalty)."

    "Based on the metrics that have been displayed in the graphs above, both K-nearest neighbors and support vector classifier are reasonable choices. To start with, although it is much faster than the other two algorithms, Naive Bayes is only able to achieve an accuracy of about 60%, while the others are performing closer to 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first KNN may appear to be a better choice, because it requires almost no training time. However there are three main reasons that the support vector classifier appears to be a better choice. First, it achieves the highest accuracy and F scores on the testing data. Second, although it requires significantly more training time than KNN, the SVC requires slightly less prediction time. In this case it is likely that the model will need to be trained infrequently (possibly only once) but used for prediction many times. If for some reason the application of model requires that it be retrained frequently or on demand then it may be better to use the KNN algorithm. The third reason is that KNN tends to become less efficient as the size of the data set increases. Therefore it would not be a good choice if the number of people in the database is expected to increase over time, which seems like a very possible occurance.   "

    "The support vector classifier works by finding the best lines or 'decision-boundary' to separate the data into people that make over $50000 and people who do not. To do this the computer goes over all of the points and finds the few that will be closest to the boundary. Then it uses a numerical technique to maximize the distance between the decision boundary and the nearest point, while also allowing for some number of points to be on the wrong side of the boudary (because the data points are not likely to be perfectly seperable).

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",

    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
